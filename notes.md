Logo Animation -

In the beginning of this animation, square has rounded corners. I chose to do this to make the animation look smooth and less distracting as the logo enters the screen. 
as the logo stops rotating, it has a little overshoot before it settles. 
Also when the rope comes down and "attaches the logo, there is a slight dip in the logo. Showing interactions between two objects showing the effect of those interactions on objects, makes the motion more believable this increases user engagement. 

Animation-timing-function like ease-in ease-out are a great way to add some physics to the motion. I also use cubic-bezier to really customize the motion and add some extra fun element like overshoots.

Spinners and Loader - 

Spinners on the other hand are moving at the constant speed so I set Animation-timing-function. And Loaders are set to ease-in. I chose a simpler approach wit loaders since the motion needed to be smoother here.
